During the first semester of 2022-2023 (September to January), I served as a teaching assistant in Probability Convergence and Integration courses at CentraleSupélec. 


The course covered topics such as modes of convergence of random variables, central limit theorems, and Lebesgue integration. My responsibilities included leading weekly tutorial sessions for students with difficulties in mathematics.
