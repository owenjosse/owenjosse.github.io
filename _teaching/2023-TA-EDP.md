During the secon semester of 2023 (Jenuary to April), I served as a teaching assistant in PDE courses at CentraleSup√©lec. 


The course covered topics such as EDO, Classification of PDE and distribution. My responsibilities included leading weekly tutorial sessions for students with deficit in mathematics.
