During the first semester of 2025-2026 (September to January), I served as a teaching assistant in Probability Convergence and Ingration courses at CentraleSupélec. 


The course covered topics such as modes of convergence of random variables, central limit theorems, and Lebesgue integration. My responsibilities included leading weekly tutorial sessions for students with deficit in mathematics.
