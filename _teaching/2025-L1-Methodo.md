During the first semester of 2025-2026 (September to January), I served as a teaching assistant (TD) in Mathematical Methodology course.


The course covered topics such as learning the basics of mathematical language, logic, sets, and applications. My responsibilities included leading tutorial sessions twice a week for first-year B.S. students in Mathematics.
