During the first semester of 2025-2026 (September to January), I served as a teaching assistant (TD) in the Statistics course.


The course covered topics such as descriptive statistics and basic probability theory. My responsibilities included leading tutorial sessions twice a week for first-year B.S. students in Economics.
